# The-Stromatolite-Geochemical-Archive
all geochemical data on stromatolites


This is the stromatolite geochmical archive (SGA), it holds geochemical data on stromatolites, i.e., lithified microbial mats that formed authigenically by the incidential interaction of microbes with ambient fluids with or without tapping and binding of ambient detrital seidments. The dataset includes stromatolitic carboante leachate trace elemntal data by Simon V. Hohl and co-workers/collaborators as well as published literature data from the last two decades. 

We encourage users of the SGA to use the data for modelling and plotting of surface water geochmistry on Earth over the last 3.5Ga. Usage of the the SGA should be indicated by citation of: XXX

If you want to contribute your own dataset please write to simon.hohl@me.com or send a pull here in github.

All the best
